## General Information
The purpose of this project was to test our knowledge based on skills learned to this point:

-CSS Styling
-Media Queries
-FlexBox
-Basic HTML/CSS Trouble Shooting

## Technologies Used
- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Git Bash


## Setup

Initial HTML/CSS Setup went pretty smooth but the further I got in, the more complex it became. This project required the following:
-ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
-New Git Hub Repo
-Read Me file
-index.html
-style.css
-images
-Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push

Once everything was setup, worked in VS Code to fully create, adjust, a working portfolio. Followed semantic HTML as best as possible Would have liked a few more hours to tweak and adjust media queries :
-added "url background" in CSS line 21 and 28 to tie the page together
-Used a lot of Divs...not sure if that is correct, but made the most sense as opposed to creating more sections
-Practiced leaving in experimental code lines and coding them out. This was an effort to annotate some of the thought/design process



## Project Status
Project is: _Continually being updated_. As i learn more JS, react, node etc, i will update this portfolio in an attempt to make as dynamic as possible.


## Room for Improvement
I think we can further improve this by adding some script.

Room for improvement:
-I need more practice with styling, specifically as it pertains to inclusion of images
